<h1>Real-Time Collaborative Stock Tracker</h1>
This project was built as a part of Free Code Camp's Full-Stack Development curriculum.

<h2>Summary</h2>
The project was built using Node.js, Express, Socket.io, Backbone.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Chart.js, and Bootstrap. 

<h2>User Stories</h2>
1. I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
2. I can add new stocks by their ticker symbol.
3. I can remove stocks.
4. I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock.
